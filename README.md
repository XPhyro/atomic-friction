# atomic-friction
2D (currently 1D) simulation of atomic scale dry-sliding friction

# How to use the project
To use the project in release mode, simply navigate to the releases tab and download the one that fits your system (currently only Linux based systems are supported); to use the project in debug mode, you need to have Unity 2019.2.11f1 installed, as the project uses Unity's graphics library to show graphics.

# Additional notes
You can ignore most of the stuff in the project and just focus on atomic-friction/Assets/Scripts. Most of the scripts located in the other directories are extension scripts that add additional functionality to the Unity editor, just to make development easier.
